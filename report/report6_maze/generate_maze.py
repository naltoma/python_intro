'''A simple maze generator with some **BUGS**

There are many kinds of algorithms for maze[1].
This module supports a maze generator with a simplified depth-first search algorithm[2] below.

step 1: Create a 2-dimensional list by init_maze().
step 2: Set the start point.
step 3: Set the direction at random to dig by set_direction().
step 4: Check the validation the current location to the direction with 2 spaces by is_space().
step 5: If valid, then dig the direction by dig_maze() and back to step 3.
